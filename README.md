Experiment No. - 3

Aim : Study of Tuple in Python

Theory : The following topics were covered during the Lecture :
1) Introduction to Tuple
2) To operate on the Commands in Tuple
3) To determine the memory loction of the Tuple Before and After Modification
4) To determine the memory loction of the List Before and After Modification
5) Practice Questions --- ( marks = (90,82,66,76,33) ; [max(),min(),len(),sum(),sum()/len(),sort()]
6) Prctice Questions (Unpack the Tuple) --- ( result = ("Maths",82,"A") ; subject,marks,grade = result)
7) Practice Question --- [attendance = ("p","a","p","p","a","p") ; attendance.count("p") ; attendance.count("a") ; if "a" in attendance)
   
   Difference between List and Tuple in Python
   1) List
      - Lists are mutable(can be modified)
      - Lists consume more memory
      - Lists have several built-in methods.
      - Iteration over lists is time-consuming.
    2) Tuple
       - Tuples are immutable(cannot be modified).
       - Tuples consumes less memory 
       - Tuples have fewer built-in methods.
       - Iterations over tuple is faster
   
Algorithm :
1) Display the Marks of the student using Tuple
   - Input the data i.e Tuple 
   - Read the data
   - Perform : max() - maximum of the list ,min() - minimum of the list , len() - Number of stuents , sum() - Sum of marks of the students , sum()/len()-average of marks of the students , sorted() - To sort the list in ascending 
   - Print the Result
2) Unpack The Tuple
   - Input the data i.e Tuple
   - Read the data
   - Perform : result = ("Maths",82,"A") ; subject,marks,grade = result ; and also use if command to chck for distnction (marks>=75)
   - Print the result
3) Employee Data
   - Input the data i.e Tuple 
   - Read the data
   - perform : attendance = ("p","a","p","p","a","p") ; attendance.count("p") ; attendance.count("a") ; if "a" in attendance (boolean value)
   - Print the result

Conclusion : The study of Tuple in Python was successfully completed
